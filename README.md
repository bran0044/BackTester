1. When using CSV files, remember to let you data be in other of: *Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume*. Try my other program https://github.com/bran0044/Historical_CSV_Generator. To generate CSV data of your desired stock.
2. Remember to change the dataname and timeframe when using different data and timeframes.
